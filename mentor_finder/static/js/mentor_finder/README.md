# Browser components
Packages that you wish to install for use on the client should be installed via
`bower` and loaded using `requirejs`

# Development components
When developing  you're probably going to want tools like Mocha, and Chai for
testing purposes, use `npm` to install these rather than `bower` so as to not
pollute the `bower_modules` directory.
